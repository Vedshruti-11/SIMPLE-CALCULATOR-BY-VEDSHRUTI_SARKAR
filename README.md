I made this calculator in the 4th sem of my college B.tech journey.
This calculator can do the following operations:

Addition: "+" operator to add.
Subtraction: "-" operator to subtract.
Multiplication: "x" to multiply.
Division: "/" to divide.
Clear: "C" to clear.
Equal: "=" to display result on screen.
